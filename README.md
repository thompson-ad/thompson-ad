# Hi, I'm Aaron ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend engineer who is passionate about building software that enables people to realise their visions. I enjoy working with include ReactJS and am interested in serverless architectures.

I'm currently working for Feed Agency in London, UK where the majority of my work to date has been building React + Redux frontend apps.
