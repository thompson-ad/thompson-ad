# Hi, I'm Aaron ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend engineer who is passionate about building software that enables people to realise their visions.

I'm currently working for Feed Agency in London, UK where the majority of my work to date has been building React + Redux frontend apps. I'm also interested in serverless architectures.
